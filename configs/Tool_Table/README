This is a sample configuration that demonstrates tool-table access from an SQL database. 
It only really works with Axis, and requires extra INI file entries, so this is the only sample
configuration that will actually work. 

The extra INI file entries are:

[TOOL]

SQL = classic.sql
TOOL_DB = tool_db

This uses an identical set of tool parameters to the normal tool table. In fact the only advantage is that there can be more than 56 entries. 

Note that other user interfaces will probably be using the legacy tool table data (which still exists in NML in this branch).
